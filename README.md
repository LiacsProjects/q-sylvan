# Q-Sylvan

Q-Sylvan extends [Sylvan](https://github.com/trolando/sylvan) with QMDDs, as well as functionality to simulate quantum circuits.


## Installation

### Dependencies
Q-Sylvan requires the following libraries: `popt` and `GMP`. On Ubuntu it should be possible to install these with
- `sudo apt-get install libpopt-dev`
- `sudo apt-get install libgmp3-dev`


### Compiling the code
After downloading or cloning the repository, from the repository folder the code can be compiled with:
1. `mkdir build`
2. `cd build`
3. `cmake ..`
4. `make`

Test can be run with `make test`.

Installing should also be possible with `make install` but this will clash with any other version of Sylvan already installed.
